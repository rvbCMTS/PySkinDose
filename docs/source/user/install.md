# Installing PySkinDose

Installing PySkinDose provides access to two interfaces.

* A python script that parses an RDSR DICOM file and creates output according to the settings used
* A scriptable interface for customizing the use of PySkinDose to enable performing calculations on already parsed data dose reports

To install PySkinDose, run the following, preferably in a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install pyskindose
```
